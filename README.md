# index.html
A simple basic todo app which teaches me basic DOM manipulations.
This is made so that one can learn how things used to work before React for DOM manipulations.
This uses child parent concept to add or change the todo task
** update **
Updated the index.html to simulate what react does under the hood
the html files basically first clears the screen and updates the new state, it just replaces the whole state, but in real life this is not very efficient that is why we need react.
React looks for the difference between the new state and the old state and only updates the part which has changed.


#class-4
This is me tryind to create my first React project with the command npm create vite@latest
this command creates a project which comes with a bunch of files which are required for an React app.
The .jsx files can return an html thats why they are jsx.
I have slightly changed the basic template to change the number to a random number when clicked on a button.
